Why are we here: The intention of this program is to provide a simple tool to remove and replace non-ASCII charters for
long blocks of text. This will include non-breaking spaces and other formatting characters that tend to come with
copy/paste from PDFs and other sources. The English Pound and Euro symbols are replaced with the ISO counterparts of GBP
and Eur, respectively. Other currency characters such as the Yen symbol have not been addressed as the program
does not recognize context between ISOs, such as Japanese Yen, JPY, and Chinese Yen, CNY.

This program makes use of the unidecode library (https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/) to do much of the heavy lifting.
This library is intended for english language use only with limited use for non-latin based alphabet characters.
Please see the above pypi page for further details.

The program will now also support the ability to compare input/output text through the use of the Redlines library
https://pypi.org/project/redlines/

The program overall is intended to be a single file executable that does not require installation for simple
distribution.
